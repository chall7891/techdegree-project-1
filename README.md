# Random Quotation Generator

An app that displays a random quotation from a famous person. Looks a lot like a fun screen saver.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the first project of twelve. The project provided the html and css files, as well as a js file with a line of code to get me started in the right direction. I was tasked with finding quotations from famous individuals, building an array of quotation objects, and displaying random quotations on a set interval, while changing the background color of the page with each new quotation.

## Installation:

Download the project files.

## Usage:

Open the index.html file on a browser.
